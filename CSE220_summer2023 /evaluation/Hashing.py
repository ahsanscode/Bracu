*Suppose, you voluntarily joined a library as an assistant librarian. Your duty is to keep the books organized. The library maintains a system where books are stored in 8 different shelves depending on the name of the books. Shelf number starts from 1. E.g 'Wings of Fire' book will be stored in shelf number 2 as it has 13 characters in the name including two single spaces with four vowels. Every shelf can have many books.*

 **Now, design the find_shelf method where you need to return the shelf number for then given book and print_All_books method which prints all the name of the books the number of shelves they belong.**
